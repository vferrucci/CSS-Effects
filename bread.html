        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>2 cups all-purpose flour, spooned into measuring cup and leveled-off</li>
          <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
          <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon ground cloves</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
          <li>1-1/2 sticks (3/4 cup) unsalted butter, softened</li>
          <li>2 cups sugar</li>
          <li>2 large eggs</li>
          <li>1 15-oz can 100% pure pumpkin</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Preheat the oven to 325°F and set an oven rack in the middle position. Generously grease two 8 x 4-inch loaf pans with butter and dust with flour (alternatively, use a baking spray with flour in it).</li>
          <li>In a medium bowl, combine the flour, salt, baking soda, baking powder, cloves, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Whisk until well combined; set aside.</li>
          <li>In a large bowl of an electric mixer, beat the butter and sugar on medium speed until just blended. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Continue beating until very light and fluffy, a few minutes. Beat in the pumpkin. The mixture might look grainy and curdled at this point - that's okay.</li>
          <li>Add the flour mixture and mix on low speed until combined.</li>
          <li>Turn the batter into the prepared pans, dividing evenly, and bake for 65 – 75 minutes, or until a cake tester inserted into the center comes out clean. Let the loaves cool in the pans for about 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        </ol>
