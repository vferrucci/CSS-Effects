# CSS-Effects
Images are not included.
All the effects are applied to the screens of 768px and larger.
I applied img[alt="pumpkin bread"] to an image with an alt attribute "pumpkin bread". I used it to apply styles to the image including box shadow. 
I used the box and text shadow effects on the h1 attribure and the pumpkin bread image. I used text-shadow: 7px 7px #bef435 and box-shadow: 5px 5px 2px #d7e0df. 
Pseudo-classes: I used .ingredients li:nth-of-type(even){background-color: #d9e2e1to;} to add color to even rows of the ingredient list.
For multi-column layout I used column-count: 2; to create two column ingredient list on devices less than 768px wide, and column-count: 1; to create one column list on larger screens. 
For linear gradients I used background-image: linear-gradient(to right bottom, #9fcc2e, #f5f7f2, #3fc6ae, #f5f7f2, #9fcc2e, #f5f7f2); to style the main tag background. 
I applied the CSS filter: contrast(120%) to the cook image in the header.
